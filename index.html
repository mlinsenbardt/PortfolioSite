                    <div>
                        <p>
                               I recently graduated from CSU Chico with a degree in Computer Science. I am a quick learner and have a diverse palate of tools, including C++, C#, Android, SQL, 
                                and Javascript experience. I have experience working in teams through my schoolwork and internships. 
                                I am looking for a job where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute to bettering myself and those I work with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have many other interests outside of software development, including playing music, reading, writing, and playing video games. I love learning new things! I am constantly pushing myself to learn a new instrument or a new web framework, because I enjoy the process of struggling through the learning process and get a lot of satisfaction from finally creating something cool or useful.
                        </p>

                    <h3 cursor="pointer">Work</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            This passion for learning new things has left me with a pretty diverse set of skills, which can be clearly seen in my body of work. In particular, I have a passion for web and mobile app development, since there are lots of tools and options for me to express my creativity. As a rule, I try to avoid using css frameworks, as I find that these tend to limit your design space and feel very restrictive to me. That being said, I have used both Bootstrap and Foundation in several web applications, both in work and in school projects.

                            <li><p><a href="http://landscapeacacia.com">Acacia Landscaping</a>: This is a website I created for my brother-in-law to promote his landscaping business. It was built using SquareSpace, but I edited some of the HTML and Javascript myself. I would have liked to have created the whole thing from scratch, but having a powerful tool like SquareSpace allowed to build this site in a matter of hours rather than days.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Music Album:</strong> This Android app allows the user to arrange music sheet arrangements using just the camera on your android device. For this project I colabborated with Masato Miyano and Christopher Hasek. The APK and source code are available at <a href="http://github.com/mlinsenbardt/MusicAlbum">this</a> Github repository.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>PanelSmith:</strong> For my senior project I developed a web app that would allow a nontechnical person to create and share webcomics. I used .NET MVC standards for this application and though I was never satisfied enough with it to pay for hosting it, I think it can still be useful and fun. The source code can be found at <a href="http://github.com/mlinsenbardt/PanelSmith">this</a> Github repository.</strong></p></li>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            My personal goals are pretty modest. I want to work on projects that excite me and challenge me. I want to be learning new things every day and apply these things in my work. I want to be always bettering myself and developing the tools to succeed. Most important of all, I want to know that my efforts are contributing to advancement in some form or another. If you can fulfill these needs, I will be happy to work with you!
